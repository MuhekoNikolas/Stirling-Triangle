## Stirling Numbers Triangle Visualization

This repo contains code I developed as part of my mathematics project. This code visualizes the Stirling triangle and includes the following features:

- Visualization of the Stirling numbers triangle with customizable parameters.
- Dynamically updating triangle values using asynchronous data fetching.
- Caching to improve performance.
